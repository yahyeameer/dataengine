"""
Recipes: turning one approved session into every future month (PRD section 4).

The PRD is blunt about why this matters. Criteria 6 and 9 "are the product. If
those two work, everything else is a matter of polish." Cleaning one file well
is a tool; doing it again next month without asking the same questions is the
thing worth paying for.

Three pieces here.

**Capture** takes the operations an accountant approved and writes them down as
an ordered, versioned step list. The one transformation it performs is
important: an inline `map_values` mapping becomes a reference to a *mapping
table*. Section 4 insists on that — a mapping frozen into recipe v3 means every
new supplier needs a recipe v4, and the automation rate never climbs past the
first month's vocabulary.

**Replay** runs those steps against a new month's file and reports what it
could not handle. Anything unresolved becomes a deviation rather than a guess.

**Invariants** (section 5.3) run *after* the steps and can fail a run that had
zero deviations. This is the silent-failure guard: a recipe that executes
perfectly against a file whose meaning has changed produces confidently wrong
numbers, and nothing else in the system would notice.

Nothing here talks to Supabase or to a model. Replay is a pure function of
(steps, table, mappings), which is what makes it testable against two fixtures
with no database at all.

    every supplier that was always spelled correctly looks brand new, which
